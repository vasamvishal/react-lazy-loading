It begins with Jake Eppinga thirty-five-year-old English teacher in Lisbon FallsMainewho makes extra money teaching GED classes. He asks his students to write about an event that changed their livesand one essay blows him away—a gruesomeharrowing story about the night more than fifty years ago when Harry Dunning’s father came home and killed his motherhis sisterand his brother with a sledgehammer. Reading the essay is a watershed moment for Jakehis life—like Harry’slike America’s in 1963—turning on a dime. Not much later his friend Alwho owns the local dinerdivulges a secret: his storeroom is a portal to the pasta particular day in 1958. And Al enlists Jake to take over the mission that has become his obsession—to prevent the Kennedy assassination. So begins Jake’s new life as George Ambersonin a different world of Ike and JFK and Elvisof big American cars and sock hops and cigarette smoke everywhere. From the dank little city of DerryMaine (where there’s Dunning business to conduct)to the warmhearted small town of JodieTexaswhere Jake falls dangerously in loveevery turn is leading eventuallyof courseto a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald and to Dallaswhere the past becomes heart-stoppingly suspensefuland where history might not be history anymore.
